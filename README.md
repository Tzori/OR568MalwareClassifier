# Project README

## Introduction
This project contains several scripts and data files used in the development of a machine learning model for a malware classification task. The purpose of this README is to provide a brief overview of the files included in the project and how to use them.

## Files
The following files are included in this project:

- `.Rhistory`: This file contains the R command history for the R console.
- `Bagging-Boosting-Script.R`: This R script implements the bagging and boosting ensemble methods.
- `DecisionTree_Script.R`: This R script implements a decision tree model.
- `ImportVar10.csv`: This CSV file contains the data used for the machine learning model.
- `Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv`: This CSV file contains the main dataset used for the machine learning models.
- `library_extraction.py`: This Python script extracts the library dependencies for the R scripts.
- `LR_Script.R`: This R script implements a logistic regression model.
- `neuralnet_script.R`: This R script implements a neural network model.
- `pca_Script.R`: This R script performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the data.
- `R libraries.txt`: This file lists the R libraries required for the R scripts.
- `README.txt`: This file.
- `rfe_Script.R`: This R script implements recursive feature elimination (RFE) for feature selection.
- `SVM_script.R`: This R script implements a support vector machine (SVM) model.
- `template_script.R`: This is a template R script for implementing new models.

## Usage
The R scripts can be run using R or RStudio. They require the libraries listed in `R libraries.txt`. The Python scripts can be run using Python 3.x.

To use the `library_extraction.py` script, run it in the command line with the following command: `python library_extraction.py R_SCRIPT.R`. Replace `R_SCRIPT.R` with the name of the R script for which you want to extract the library dependencies.

## Conclusion
This project provides a range of scripts and data files for developing a machine learning model for a malware classification task. Each file serves a specific purpose and can be used in combination with others to create an effective model.
