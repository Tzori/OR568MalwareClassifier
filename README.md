For more information, see the [README file](/readMeIndv/model_metrics_readme.md).



- `.Rhistory`: A file containing a history of R commands and outputs from previous R sessions.
- `Bagging-Boosting-Script.R`: A script file containing code for building bagging and boosting models to classify malware.
- `citations.R`: A script file containing R code to generate a list of citations used in this project.
- `citations.txt`: A text file containing a list of citations used in this project.
- `data_preprocess.R`: A script file containing code to preprocess the malware dataset.
- `DecisionTree_Script.R`: A script file containing code for building decision tree models to classify malware.
- `ImportVar10.csv`: A CSV file containing import variables for the malware dataset.
- `Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv`: A CSV file containing the final preprocessed dataset for the malware classification project, obtained from Kaggle.
- `library_extraction.py`: A Python script file containing code to extract libraries from Windows Portable Executable (PE) files.
- `LR_Script.R`: A script file containing code for building logistic regression models to classify malware.
- `model_metrics.csv`: A CSV file containing model evaluation metrics for the different models trained in this project.
- `model_metrics.R`: A script file containing R code to generate model evaluation metrics.
- `neuralnet_script.R`: A script file containing code for building neural network models to classify malware.
- `pca_Script.R`: A script file containing code for performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the malware dataset.
- `preprocessed_data.csv`: A CSV file containing the preprocessed malware dataset.
- `R libraries.txt`: A text file containing a list of R libraries used in this project.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, containing an overview of the repository and a brief description of the files it contains.
- `rfe_Script.R`: A script file containing code for performing recursive feature elimination (RFE) on the malware dataset.
- `SVM_script.R`: A script file containing code for building support vector machine (SVM) models to classify malware.
- `template_script.R`: A script file containing a template for building R scripts.

## Usage
The R scripts can be run using R or RStudio. They require the libraries listed in `R libraries.txt`. The Python scripts can be run using Python 3.x.

To use the `library_extraction.py` script, run it in the command line with the following command: `python library_extraction.py R_SCRIPT.R`. Replace `R_SCRIPT.R` with the name of the R script for which you want to extract the library dependencies.

## Conclusion
This project provides a range of scripts and data files for developing a machine learning model for a malware classification task. Each file serves a specific purpose and can be used in combination with others to create an effective model.
