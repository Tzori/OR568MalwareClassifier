## RFE Analysis Script

This R script performs Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) analysis on a given dataset. RFE is a method used for selecting the most important features for a machine learning model by recursively removing features that have the least importance until a desired number of features is reached. The script performs the following steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries, including AppliedPredictiveModeling, caret, e1071, corrplot, lattice, and dplyr.
2. Load the dataset. Make sure to set the working directory to the location of the file.
3. Label the response variable column name and check for null values.
4. Check for near-zero variance and remove the columns that have zero variance.
5. Find highly correlated variables and remove them if their correlation magnitude is greater than or equal to 0.8.
6. Standardize the variables using the scale() function or Matt's normalization method.
7. Create a test/train split with a 70/30 ratio.
8. Remove the response variable column from the training and test datasets.
9. Set up the control option for RFE analysis with repeated cross-validation.
10. Run the RFE analysis with a range of feature sizes (1 to 8, for example).
11. Print the RFE analysis results and summary.
12. Plot the predictor strength with a bar plot showing the variable importance score for each predictor.

Note that some of the code in the script is commented out and may need to be adjusted depending on the dataset and analysis requirements.
