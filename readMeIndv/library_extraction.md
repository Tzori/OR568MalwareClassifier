# R Script Library Extractor

This python script extracts the names of R libraries used in a directory of R scripts and saves them to a text file. It can be helpful for managing and documenting the package dependencies of your R projects. 

## Usage

1. Set the `directory` variable to the path of the directory containing your R scripts.
2. Run the script.
3. The script will scan all the R script files in the specified directory.
4. It will extract library statements from the scripts using a regular expression pattern.
5. The names of the packages mentioned in the library statements will be saved to a text file named "R libraries.txt".

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The script assumes that R scripts in the specified directory have the ".R" file extension.

## Dependencies

- None

## Example

Suppose you have a directory `c:\ProjectDirectory\` containing several R scripts. Running this script will extract the library statements from each script and save the unique package names to a file named "R libraries.txt".

## Note

- This script assumes that library statements follow the common format `library(package_name)`. If your R scripts use a different format or import packages in other ways, you may need to modify the regular expression pattern (`library_pattern`) to match your specific use case.

Please refer to the script comments for more details.
