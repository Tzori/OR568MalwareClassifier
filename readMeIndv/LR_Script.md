## Logistic Regression Modeling

This R script demonstrates how to perform logistic regression modeling for binary classification using the AppliedPredictiveModeling library in R. The purpose of this script is to load, clean, preprocess, and analyze data in preparation for building a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model is built using the rfe function from the caret package. The resulting model is evaluated for performance on a test set.

### Loading the Data

The script begins by loading the necessary libraries and dataset. The dataset is read from a csv file, and the response variable column is labeled.

### Preprocessing the Data

After loading the data, the script performs several preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling. The first step is to remove columns with near-zero variance. The script then removes highly correlated variables with a correlation magnitude of 0.8 or higher. The remaining variables are then standardized using either scaling or normalization.

### Creating the Train and Test Sets

Next, the script creates a 70/30 split between the standardized variables and separates them into training and testing datasets. The "legitimate" column is removed from both datasets, and the remaining variables are assigned to x_train and x_test. The "legitimate" column is assigned to y_train and y_test respectively.

### Building the Model

The logistic regression model is built using the rfe function with repeated cross-validation. The rfe function performs recursive feature elimination, selecting the best subset of variables to use in the logistic regression model. The model is built using the training data and evaluated using the testing data. The final model summary and predictor strength plots are displayed.

### Conclusion

This R script provides a basic framework for performing logistic regression modeling for binary classification. The rfe function in the caret package provides a robust method for selecting the best subset of variables to use in the model. The resulting model can be evaluated for performance using a test set, providing a measure of the model's predictive power.
