# bagging-boosting-script.R

This script includes a bagged decision tree model to predict whether a transaction is legitimate or not based on a dataset from Kaggle.

**Required Libraries**

The following libraries are required to run this script:

- AppliedPredictiveModeling
- caret
- e1071
- corrplot
- lattice
- dplyr
- caretEnsemble
- ROCR

**Data Loading and Cleaning**

The dataset "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv" should be loaded into your working directory before running this script. After loading, null values are checked for, and columns with near-zero variance are dropped. Highly correlated variables are also removed from the data frame.

**Model Building**

After data cleaning, the data is partitioned into a training and test set. The bagged decision tree model is built using the treebag method, with the accuracy metric, and a repeated cross-validation method. The confusion matrix is then calculated on the test set.

**ROC Curve and Threshold Tuning**

The ROC curve is plotted using the ggplot2 library. Thresholds are also evaluated to minimize false positives.

**How to Run the Script**

1. Install the required libraries using `install.packages()`.
2. Load the dataset "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv" into your working directory.
3. Copy and paste the code into your R console or R script.
4. Run the code.

Note: The runtime of the script is approximately 12-15 minutes.
