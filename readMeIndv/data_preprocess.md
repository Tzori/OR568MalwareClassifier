# Preprocessing Data

This R script loads in a dataset named "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv" and performs preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling. The script uses several libraries including dplyr, ggplot2, reshape2, caret, corrplot, lattice, and e1071.

### Required Libraries
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- reshape2
- caret
- corrplot
- lattice
- e1071

### How to Use
1. Set your working directory to the directory where all project R scripts are located.
2. Ensure the dataset "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv" is in the same directory.
3. Copy and paste the code into your R console or script.
4. Run the code.

### Output
The script outputs a preprocessed dataset named "preprocessed_data.csv" in the same directory as the script. This dataset has gone through several preprocessing steps including removing columns with near zero variance, highly correlated variables, and converting the response variable to a factor. The script also generates a heatmap plot of the preprocessed data variables.
