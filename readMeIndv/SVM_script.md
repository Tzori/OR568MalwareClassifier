# SVM Classifier Script

This script aims to preprocess data and train an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to predict the legitimacy of a transaction. The script is composed of the following steps:

1. Removal Recap: The preprocessed data is exported to a CSV file named preprocessed_data.csv.
2. Split Test Train Data: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets.
3. Create Model Simple SVM on 10% training data: An SVM classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The performance is evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and an ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve with its AUC (Area Under the Curve).
4. Kernel Function Comparisons: SVM models with different kernel functions are trained and evaluated. The kernels functions are linear, polynomial, radial, and sigmoid. The performance is evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and an ROC curve with its AUC.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the script:

- caret
- ggplot2
- ggpubr
- pROC

## Usage

To run the script, open the R console and execute the following command:

```{R}
source("svm_classifier.R")
```
The script will produce a set of plots and print various performance metrics. The results can be analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of different kernel functions and their impact on the performance of the SVM classifier.

Note that the script uses a fixed random seed (set.seed(568)) to ensure reproducibility.
