# Citations.R Script

This R script reads in a text file containing a list of R libraries to cite. The script then loops through each library and captures the citation, with error handling for non-existent libraries. The citations are saved to both an empty vector and a text file.

## Required Libraries

This script does not require any additional libraries beyond the base R package.

## How to Use

1. Create a text file named "R libraries.txt" containing the names of the R libraries to cite, each on a new line.
2. Copy and paste the code from citations.R into your R console or script.
3. Run the code.

## Output

The script outputs the proper citation for each R library in the "R libraries.txt" file to the console. Additionally, the citations are saved to a text file named "citations.txt" in the same directory as the script.
