README file PCA script:

## Introduction:

This script is designed to perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on a dataset named "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv". The script is written in R programming language and uses several packages such as AppliedPredictiveModeling, dplyr, tidyr, Correlplot, lattice, caret, and e1071. PCA is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining as much information as possible.

## Requirements:

To run this script, R and RStudio should be installed on your computer. Additionally, the following packages should be installed before running the script:

- AppliedPredictiveModeling
- dplyr
- tidyr
- Correlplot
- lattice
- caret
- e1071
- factoextra

## Usage:

1. Open the RStudio software and navigate to the working directory where the "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv" dataset is located.
2. Copy and paste the entire script into the R console or into a new script file.
3. Install the required packages using the 'install.packages()' command.
4. Load the required packages using the 'library()' command.
5. Run the script to perform PCA on the dataset.

## Description of the script:

- The script begins by reading in the "Kaggle-data-FINAL.csv" dataset and removing the 'md5' column from it.
- The script then performs some initial data exploration, such as printing the length of the dataset and checking for the mean correlation among the variables to determine eligibility for PCA.
- The script then runs PCA on the entire dataset and on the dataset without the 'id' column.
- The script creates a scree plot to visualize the cumulative percentage of variance which each component accounts for.
- The script filters high correlations using the 'findCorrelation()' function and reduces the dataset to 48 variables.
- The script uses the 'factoextra' package to visualize the results of the PCA analysis, including a scree plot and a graph of variables.

## Output:

The script generates several outputs, including:

- A summary of the PCA analysis
- A scree plot of the cumulative percentage of variance accounted for by each principal component
- A graph of variables
- A list of eigenvalues

## Conclusion:

This script provides a simple and effective way to perform PCA on a large dataset using R. It can be easily modified to work with other datasets and can be used to gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.
