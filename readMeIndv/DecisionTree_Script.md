## Readme

This R script includes data cleaning and machine learning modeling steps for the given dataset. The dataset is read and cleaned, then a decision tree model is trained and evaluated.

## Relevant Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the script:

- AppliedPredictiveModeling
- caret
- e1071
- corrplot
- lattice
- dplyr
- rpart
- rpart.plot
- pROC
- ROCR

## Load Dataset

The dataset is read using the read.csv function and stored in the df object. The response variable column name is labeled as legitimate.

## Data Cleaning

The `nearZeroVar` function is used to identify columns with near zero variance. Columns with zero variance are removed. The `md5` column is also dropped since it is not needed.

Next, highly correlated variables with a correlation magnitude of 0.8 or higher are identified and removed from the dataset.

The variables are then standardized using two methods: using `scale` and using Matt's normalization. After standardization, a 70/30 train/test split is created using the `createDataPartition` function.

## Machine Learning Modeling

A decision tree model is trained on the training dataset using the `rpart` function. The model is evaluated on the test dataset using the `confusionMatrix` and `roc` functions.

Model tuning is performed using the `mlr` package. A grid of `maxdepth` values from 1 to 30 is defined, and cross-validation is performed using `CV`. The `Metrics` and `plotly` packages are also used for model evaluation and visualization.
