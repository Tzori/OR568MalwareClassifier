# model_metrics.R

This script loads the "model_metrics.csv" file, which contains metrics for different models, including their accuracy, AUC, Kappa, and run time. The script provides data cleaning and transformation using the `dplyr` package, and creates several visualizations using the `ggplot2` and `ggbeeswarm` libraries. 

## Libraries
The `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages are required to run this script.

## Data Loading
The script reads in the "model_metrics.csv" file using the `read.csv` function, and saves it as a dataframe.

## Visualizations
The script creates several visualizations to compare the model metrics, including:

- A scatterplot of accuracy vs AUC
- A scatterplot of accuracy vs Kappa
- A scatterplot of Kappa vs accuracy for models with Kappa > 0.8, with models grouped by type using color
- A bar chart of accuracy for each model type, ordered by decreasing accuracy
- A bar chart of Kappa for each model type, ordered by decreasing Kappa
- A bar chart of run time in minutes for each model type, ordered by decreasing run time

These visualizations are created using the `ggplot2` and `ggbeeswarm` libraries.
