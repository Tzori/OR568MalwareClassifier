# Template Script

This is a template R script that can be used for data preprocessing and modeling using various machine learning techniques. The script includes the following sections:

## Load Dependencies

This section loads the necessary libraries required for the script, such as tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot, caret, corrplot, and lattice.

## Load Dataset

This section loads the dataset into the script. The script assumes that the dataset is in a CSV format and is saved in the working directory. You will need to specify the file name and set your working directory before running this script.

## Pre-Process Data

This section preprocesses the data by first identifying and dropping near-zero variance columns, and then identifying and removing highly correlated variables with a correlation magnitude greater than or equal to 0.8.

## Split Test Train Data

This section is where the user creates a test/train split.

## Create Model

This section creates the machine learning model. You will need to fill in the appropriate code for the type of model you want to create.

## Validate Model

This section validates the model by running it on the test data and calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Create Visualizations

This section creates visualizations of the model's aspects using various R packages such as ggplot and corrplot.

Note that this script is intended to be a template and will require modification to fit your specific dataset and analysis requirements.
